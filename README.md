# HTML Email Signatures
 HTML Email signatures – OSX, iOS, Gmail and Outlook

#Installation

#Apple OSX Mail:
I got started on this odyssey after reading Matt Coneybeare's excellent article 'How to Make an HTML Signature in Apple Mail for macOS Catalina 10.15' and he explains how to install and HTML signature on OSX Catalina 10.15: http://matt.coneybeare.me/how-to-make-an-html-signature-in-apple-mail-for-macos-catalina-10-dot-15

#Apple iOS Mail on iPhone/iPad
• Open the code file in a browser > select all > copy
• On your iPhone/iPad go to settings > Mail > Signatures > paste into the box (if the styles don’t look correct, shake to undo – you should get a pop up to remove the styling)
N.B. This is much easier to do if you have ‘HandOff’ activated as you can copy and paste from your computer

#Gmail
• Open the html_signature_ios.html code file in a browser (NOT Chrome) > select all > copy
• Open Gmail in a browser (NOT Chrome – this will add styles) Go to Settings > General > scroll down to signature > create new
• Paste into window and save

#Outlook (on Windows)
• In Outlook, go to signatures
• Create new signature and save and close Outlook
• In File Explorer > C Drive\Users\[YOUR USRNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Signatures
• Open the html_signature_outlook.html file using a text or code editor and copy the code
• Open the signature file you created using a text or code editor
• Paste into the signature file
• Save and close the text editor
N.B. This might also work with Outlook on OSX but I couldn’t test it.
